Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed

I'll make a cup of coffee for your head

I'll get you up and going out of bed

And I promise that one day I'll feel fine

And I promise that one day I'll feel alright
And I'll make a cup of coffee with the right amount of sugar
How you like it
And I'll make a cup of coffee with the right amount of sugar
How you like it
How you like it
Don't know how long I'd stay for
It's okay, I'll knock on your door
Won't you come down and get me?
I like it when you hold me tight
You make me feel nice
The green in your eyes
Makes me feel warm inside
